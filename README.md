# GlobalKeyboard
Provide global keyboard (and potentially mouse) in max 4 (or greater).
Global keyboard means that you can have keyboard activity even if your patche/collective/app is in background.

It's based on the library jnativehook : https://github.com/kwhat/jnativehook
YOU NEED to put the library in the right place

Then put the content of classes in your java classes folder.
